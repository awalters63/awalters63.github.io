	<h2>Level 6 - In the Dark</h2>
	<h3>Pre-Assembly:</h3>
		<p><a href="maria.html">Maria</a> returns to <a href="carmen.cafe.html">Carmen's</a> and finds <a href="carmen.html">Carmen</a> frantically cleaning. She tells Maria that she is scared of <a href="helena.html">Helena</a> finding the cafe a mess, and Maria can tell how stressed she is. Carmen brings Maria to a back room and asks her to help her assemble a neon sign.</p>
		
	<h3>Assembly - Carmen's: Neon Sign</h3>
		<p>This level takes place in the shadows of a window and blinds. The coffee cup in the corner leads to the menu.</p>

	<h3>Post-Assembly:</h3>
