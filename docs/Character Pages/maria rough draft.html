	<h3>Personality</h3>
		<p>Maria is a restorer by trade. She grew up in her parents' antique store and used to daydream about where each of the objects came from. She left her parents a year ago to travel and restore beloved possessions, a career that she loves. She is very helpful, often going the extra mile to help her clients.</p>
		
	<h3>Relationships</h3>
		<h4>Her Parents</h4>
			<p>When Maria told her parents that she wanted to leave in order to travel the world, they didn't want her to leave. She remembers them finding work to be busy with, so that they wouldn't have to talk to her about her leaving. The day she left, Maria stole a suitcase out of their store and hadn't called them since. However, with the lessons she's learned in <a href="#">Bellariva</a>, Maria finally feels ready to reach back out to them to apologize.</p>
			
		<h4><a href="#">Izzy</a></h4>
			<p>Izzy is the first person Maria meets in Bellariva. She fixes her tape deck and plays along when Izzy pays her in knick-knacks. She sees her relationship with her parents in Izzy's relationship with Joseph. She covers for Izzy when asked to and encourages her curiosity when it comes to learning how to repair things. In <a href="#">Level 13</a>, she even traded her repair manual to Izzy for a toy dinosaur.</p>
			
		<h4><a href="#">Joseph</a></h4>
			<p>Joseph invites Maria to his house in order to pay her for Izzy's repair. She sympathizes with how overworked he is, while also seeing her parents in him. The more things Maria fixes for Joseph, the more willing he is to talk through his emotions with her, which helps him realize that Izzy is the most important thing in his life.</p>
			
		<h4><a href="#">Carmen</a></h4>
			<p>Maria first meets Carmen when she asks for help with repairing her phone. The two clicked instantly, with Maria being willing to help her with anything she can. After Maria leaves Bellariva, Carmen writes to her to keep her updated.</p>
			
		<h4><a href="#">Helena</a></h4>
			<p>Helena asks for Maria by name when she needs a camera fixed. While initially Maria was wary of her, given what Carmen told her and what she saw herself, the more she learns about Helena as a child the more she sympathizes with her.</p>
