	<h2>Izzy</h2>
	<h3>Physical Appearance</h3>
		<p>Izzy is around seven years old, with brown hair and brown eyes. She wears a teal jacket, the same her mom wears in their family portrait, over a pink shirt and jeans. She has her hair pushed back with a pink headband and wears yellow headphones around her neck. She also carries a pink backpack filled with notebooks around with her.<br><br>In the family portrait found in <a href="#">Level 2</a>,Izzy is much younger, with a pink bow in her hair and wearing a pink tank top, jean shorts, and pink shoes.</p>
		
	<h3>Personality</h3>
		<p>Izzy is described by Maria as a happy kid, but that part of her life has been shattered by the death of her mom. She treasures the things that remind her of her mom, such as her tape desk and the music box. She can get frustrated easily, lashing out, but she is openly affectionate with her father once they reconcile.</p>
		
	<h3>Relationships</h3>
		<h4><a href="#">Joseph</a></h4>
			<p>At the beginning of the game, Izzy and Joseph have a strained relationship. She thinks that he cares more for his work than he does for her, and that he only sees her for work. However, after the festival and their day of bonding, Izzy and Joseph are on much better terms. She tells him that she'll never get bored of him and Maria says she has never looked happier.</p>
			
		<h4><a href="#">Her Mom</a></h4>
			<p>Izzy lost her mom not long ago, something that greatly affected her. She wears her mom's jacket around her shoulders and takes caution when holding the tape of her mom singing. When Izzy was younger, her mother would sing her to sleep every night.</p>

		<h4><a href="#">Maria</a></h4>
			<p>Izzy looks up to Maria, impressed with her skill of repairing. She confides in Maria when given the chance and trusts her to keep things quiet from her dad. Before Maria leaves <a href="#">Bellariva</a>, Izzy trades her a dinosaur toy for a repair manual so that she can be a repair woman too.</p>
