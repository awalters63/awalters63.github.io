	<h2>Level 8 - Momentary</h2>
	<h3>Pre-Restoration</h3>
		<p><a href="#">Maria</a> rings the doorbell at the front door, but notices stains on her overalls too late. <a href="#">Joseph</a> appears and asks about them, so Maria covers for <a href="#">Izzy</a>. They move to Joseph's <a href="#">office</a>, where Joseph tells Maria that he is busy but he's looking forward to the festival. Because he has to be on a tight schedule, he needs to fix his watch.</p>
		
	<h3>Restoration - Schonfelder Automatic 36: Watch</h3>
		<p>This level takes place on the stone tiles of Joseph's office. The coffee cup in the corner leads to the menu.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Remove the watch from the band and set the band to the side.</li>
			<li>Unscrew the back of the watch and remove the gear piece.</li>
			<li>Remove the gears from the broken bits.</li>
			<li>Remove the watch face and unscrew the broken glass so that it can be replaced, screwing new glass on.</li>
			<li>Place the watch face, gears, and the back, adding the screws back in when necessary.</li>
			<li>Add the watch band back on.</li>
		</ol>
		
	<h3>Post-Restoration</h3>
		<p>Maria notices the engraving on the back of the watch when handing it back to Joseph. He admits that the watch makes him feel like his wife is still there. He reflects on how little time they had and how he feels like Izzy hates him. The phone rings and Joseph has to take it, so Maria leaves. She hopes that the watch can bring him some piece.</p>
