	<h2>Level 2 - Lullaby</h2>
	<h3>Pre-Restoration:</h3>
		<p>It is <a href="maria.html">Maria</a>'s first morning in <a href="location.select.html">Bellariva</a>. She wanders through the town, noticing the preparations in the <a href="mainsquare.html">Main Square</a>. <a href="izzy.html">Izzy</a> taps her on the shoulder and asks her to fix her cassette deck and tape.</p>
		
	<h3>Restoration - Minato: Cassette Recorder</h3>
		<p>This level takes place on the stones of the <a href="mainsquare.html">Main Square</a>. The coffee cup in the corner leads to the menu.</p>

	<h3>Post-Restoration:</h3>
		<p>Izzy tucks the tape deck away carefully and Maria asks who the singer was. Izzy tells her that it was her dead mom. Her friends call her away and Izzy pays Maria in a variety of knick-knacks, which Maria acceptingly writes her a receipt for. After Izzy leaves, Maria reflects on how broken she seems over her mom's death, something Maria can't fix.</p>
