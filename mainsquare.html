	<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>The main square is the location of the food festival. When <a href="maria.html">Maria</a> first arrives in <a href="location.select.html">Bellariva</a>, the main square is busy with preparations. Once the food festival is underway, there are stalls of food from Bellariva's cafes and restaurants, with an incredible smell in the air.</p>
		
	<h3>Food Festival</h3>
		<p>The food festival is Bellariva's claim to fame, with tourists like Maria coming from all over to taste the food. Bellariva tradition is that <a href="joseph.html">Joseph</a>, as mayor, goes around to each stall and tastes their food. At the end of the festival, he crowns one stall as the "Best Food in Bellariva." In the food festival during the game, <a href="carmen.html">Carmen</a> wins this title. In addition to the food stalls, there is also a market held.</p>
