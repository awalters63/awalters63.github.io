	<h3>Relationships</h3>
		<h4><a href="#">Izzy</a></h4>
			<p>At the beginning of the game, Joseph and Izzy had a strained relationship. He thought that she hated him and he didn't make enough time for her. But after the festival and a day of bonding with Izzy, Joseph realizes that she is his top priority. Everything else comes after her.</p>
			
		<h4><a href="#">His Wife</a></h4>
			<p>Joseph and his wife loved each other deeply. He describes her as a brilliant woman and that she would want him to be the best father he could be. She is the one who gifted him his watch, which he wears everyday.</p>
			
		<h4><a href="#">His Father</a></h4>
			<p>Joseph's father was a strict man, who had high expectations. Joseph didn't live up to his standards and he realized he was turning into his father when he spent almost all of his time on work.</p>

		<h4><a href="#">Maria</a></h4>
			<p>Joseph initially only meant to pay Maria for Izzy's repair, but she endears herself to him after repairing his statue. As he sees her more, he opens up more to her, talking about his wife and his grief. Maria is responsible for the shift in Joseph's attitude.</p>
