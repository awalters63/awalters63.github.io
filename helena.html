	<section id="physical appearance">
	<h3>Physical Appearance</h3>
		<p>Maria describes Helena as "looking immaculate", without a stray hair or crease. She has short dark brown hair and brown eyes, with yellow nails and glasses. She wears a blue striped button-up, blue pants, and a belt with a gold buckle. She also wears pink eyeshadow and lipstick. </p>

	<h3>Personality</h3>
		<p>Helena has the nickname of "Hurricane Helena", but it is mostly a facade. Helena can be a bit snobby and chic, but in truth she's insecure after having lost her job. She's hiding it because she doesn't know what to do next.</p>

	<h3>Relationships</h3>
		<h4><a href="carmen.html">Carmen</a></h4>
			<p>As kids, Helena pushed Carmen to be the best she could be. However, when she moved out, she was too busy to return home and they grew apart, until the only thing connecting them was Helena sending Carmen money. She put down Carmen often, making digs at her here and there, but it came from a place of insecurity. Once she sells her camera to pay for Carmen's debts, the two are able to reconcile and work together.</p>
			
			
		<h4><a href="maria.html">Maria</a></h4>
			<p>At first, Helena is cold to Maria. But after she fixes her camera, Helena warms to her and opens up, telling her her complaints about Carmen and <a href="#">Bellariva</a>. She tells Maria about her lack of money before Carmen and thanks her afterwards for her support.</p>
