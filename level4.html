	<h3>Restoration - Everdial: Rotary Phone</h3>

	<h3>Post-Restoration:</h3>
		<p>Maria gives Carmen the phone back, but she doesn't seem enthused to call her sister. Carmen muses about her bills and rents before telling Maria her coffee is on the house. She calls her sister and it becomes clear that she needs to borrow money from her. However, she doesn't want to see her and, when her sister decides to visit, begins to stress. She asks Maria to come by tomorrow.</p>
