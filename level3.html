	<h2>Level 3 - Shattered</h2>
	<h3>Pre-Restoration:</h3>
		<p>After repairing <a href="izzy.html">Izzy</a>'s cassette deck, <a href="maria.html">Maria</a> did a couple more small jobs around town. When she returns to her <a href="hotel.html">hotel</a>, there is a message waiting for her, asking her to visit <a href="joseph.and.izzy.house.html">Jospeh' and Izzy's house</a>. Here, she meets <a href="joseph.html">Joseph</a>, the mayor of Bellariva, who wants to pay her for fixing Izzy's cassette deck. Maria notices a statue, formerly belonging to Joseph's father, that had been broken by Izzy, which Joseph asks her to fix.</p>

	<h3>Post-Repair:</h3>
		<p>Joseph talks about his relationship with his father and sets the statue down next to a family portrait of him, his wife, and Izzy. He tells Maria that he has been working late in preparation for the festival, which prompts her to remember how her parents would find ways to be busy so they wouldn't have to talk about her leaving. She hopes that in addition to his work, Joseph is making time for Izzy.</p>
