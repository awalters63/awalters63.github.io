	<h2>Level 10 - Boiling Point</h2>
	<h3>Pre-Assembly</h3>
		<p>It's the day of the festival, which means <a href="maria.html">Maria</a> finally gets a break. She goes to see <a href="carmen.html">Carmen</a>, the only one still cooking. <a href="helena.html">Helena</a>, who was meant to help her, never showed up after telling Carmen that she lied about the money. Carmen is running out of her soup, so she needs Maria's help with creating another batch.</p>
		
	<h3>Assembly - Carmen's: Four-Season Soup</h3>
		<p>This level takes place on the stones of the <a href="mainsquare.html">Main Square</a>. The coffee cup in the corner leads to the menu.</p>

Carmen remarks that she regrets asking so much of her.</p>
