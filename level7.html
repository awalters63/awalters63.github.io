	<h3>Post-Restoration</h3>
		<p>As Izzy plays her game, Maria makes to leave. Izzy asks her to keep it from Joseph, because he'll think she broke it on purpose. Izzy tells Maria that she doesn't want to go to the festival, as she thinks that her dad doesn't see her unless it's for his work. After saying this, she disappears into the garden and Maria reflects on her relationship with her parents.</p>
