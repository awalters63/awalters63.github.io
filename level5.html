	<h2>Level 5 - In Focus</h2>
	<h3>Pre-Restoration:</h3>
		<p>Before <a href="maria.html">Maria</a> can go to visit <a href="carmen.html">Carmen</a>, the <a href="hotel.html">hotel</a> reception desk calls her and tells her that another guest has asked for her. Here, Maria meets <a href="helena.html">Helena</a>, who asks her to fix her camera. Maria can't help but notice the stark contrast between Carmen and Helena.</p>
		
	<h3>Restoration - Lenax U2G 58: Camera</h3>
		<p>This level takes place on the hotel tile, under the shadows of plants. The coffee cup in the corner leads to the menu.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Unscrew the different parts of the camera and disassemble it.</li>
			<li>Remove the broken mirror nad replace it.</li>
			<li>Rotate the mirror until the light is reflecting in the same path as the diagram and add the battery.</li>
			<li>Reassemble the camera and ensure everything is screwed in.</li>
		</ol>
		
	<h3>Post-Restoration:</h3>
		<p>Maria is envious of the camera and Helena tells her how it cost her several months of salary. It makes Maria question why Helena is staying in the same hotel she is, as she chose it due to it being cheap. Helena makes a disparaging comment about Carmen and complains that all she seems to want from her is money.</p>
