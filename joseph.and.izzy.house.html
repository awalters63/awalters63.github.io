	<h2>Joseph' & Izzy's House</h2>
	<section id="descriptions">
	<h3>Description</h3>
		<p><a href="joseph.html">Joseph</a> and <a href="izzy.html">Izzy</a> live in a quaint little seafront cottage. It's a beautiful house even with its flaking paintwork and chipped tiles. After Joseph and Izzy reconcile, there is a noticeable transformation where the house feels more alive.</p>
		
	<h3>Garden & Playhouse</h3>
		<p>Before the festival, the garden is beautiful and unruly, overflowing with colorful flowers. The wooden playhouse is crawling with vines and the entrance is blocked by a large rosebush. Inside, the floor is worn and there is a blue table that Izzy has doodled on. After the festival, Joseph cleans the playhouse and the garden, letting light into the house.</p>
		
	<h3>Office</h3>
		<p>Joseph's office is an orderly room filled with papers and ledgers. This is where Joseph keeps his father's statue and the picture of his family.</p>
