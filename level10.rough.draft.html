	<h2>Level 10 - Boiling Point</h2>
	<h3>Pre-Assembly</h3>
		<p>It's the day of the festival, which means <a href="#">Maria</a> finally gets a break. She goes to see <a href="#">Carmen</a>, the only one still cooking. <a href="#">Helena</a>, who was meant to help her, never showed up after telling Carmen that she lied about the money. Carmen is running out of her soup, so she needs Maria's help with creating another batch.</p>
		
	<h3>Assembly - Carmen's: Four-Season Soup</h3>
		<p>This level takes place on the stones of the <a href="#">Main Square</a>. The coffee cup in the corner leads to the menu.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Assemble the stove according to the diagram.</li>
			<li>Flick the lever and strick a match, lighting the fire.</li>
			<li>Put the pot on top of the fire and pour the broth in.</li>
			<li>Add cut up butter, carrots, broccoli, tomatoes, mushrooms, and onions, according to the recipe. <i>In order to finish the level, rather than listening to the recipe, only one of each ingredient needs to be added.</i></li>
			<li>Take a ladle of the soup.</li>
		</ol>
		
	<h3>Post-Assembly</h3>
		<p>Carmen adds the finishing touches to the soup and <a href="#">Joseph</a> and <a href="#">Izzy</a> arrive at her stall. Izzy loves the soup nad Joseph compliments Carmen. Carmen tells Maria that she wishes Helena could have been there to see her succeed, and that as a child Helena always pushed Carmen to be the best she could be. Carmen remarks that she regrets asking so much of her.</p>
