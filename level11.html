	<h2>Level 11 - Harmony</h2>
	<h3>Pre-Restoration</h3>
		<p>It's the day after the festival, and <a href="maria.html">Maria</a> leaves in a day. She goes to see <a href="carmen.html">Carmen</a> before she leaves, and her <a href="carmen.cafe.html">cafe</a> is booming. <a href-"helena.html">Helena</a> is helping, serving customers at the cafe. Carmen brings Maria upstairs and tells her that Helena sold her camera to pay for the cafe's debts. She'll be moving in with Carmen and Carmen wants to give her an old record player that they used to listen to as kids.</p>
		
	<h3>Restoration - Idaphone Fidelity: Record Player</h3>
		<p>This level takes place on the wood of the cafe's balcony, in the shadow of a plant. The coffee cup in the corner leads to the menu.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Turn the record player on and off.</li>
			<li>Remove all the pieces and the covering.</li>
			<li>Fix the wiring, adding two new wires.</li>
			<li>Ty turning the record player on again.</li>
			<li>Remove the motor and replace it with the correct one.</li>
			<li>Try turning the record player on again.</li>

	<h3>Post-Restoration</h3>
		<p>Helena apppears and expresses shock that Carmen kept the record player. They listen to the music together and Helena tells Maria that she loves her sister more than the camera. She is going to stick around for a while to make up for lost time. It makes Maria think of her relationship with her parents, and how she doesn't know how to fix her relationship with them.</p>
