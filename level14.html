	<h2>Level 14 (Epilogue) - Carmen's Letter</h2>
	<h3>Pre-Assembly</h3>
		<p>This is the only level where <a href="maria.html">Maria</a> is not the main character. Instead, <a href="carmen.html">Carmen</a> is writing a letter to Maria, telling her what she's missed in the time sense leaving. Her <a href="carmen.cafe.html">cafe</a> has been manic and <a href="helena.html">Helena</a> has been helping her manage it. But although Helena has adapted well, Carmen can tell she misses the city and wants to make her a fancy coffee with milk art, like she used to get. She builds her new coffee machine all by herself.</p>
		
	<h3>Assembly - Newcombe Classic: Expresso Machine</h3>
		<p>This level takes place on a wooden backdrop. Rather than a coffee cup, a cookie in the corner leads to the menu.</p>

	<h3>Post-Assembly</h3>
		<p>Carmen wasn't the proudest of her coffee, but Helena enjoyed it. She spent a long time smelling the coffee, and was impressed by the art, even though she couldn't figure out what it was. She asked for another one, which means Carmen has to practice now. Carmen thanks Maria for all of her help, realizing how hard the repairs she made for her were.</p>
