	<h2>Level 9 - The Bigger Picture</h2>
	<h3>Pre-Restoration</h3>
		<p>It's <a href="maria.html">Maria</a>'s last job of the day, at <a href="carmen.apartment.html">Carmen's apartment</a>. <a href="helena.html">Helena</a> opens the door and makes a remark on how dirty the apartment is. She's cleaning it out in order to find items to sell at the market during the festival, in order to help with <a href="carmen.html">Carmen</a>'s money struggles. She pulls out a broken slide projector, previously owned by their parents.</p>
		
	<h3>Restoration - Omnicolor: Slide Projector</h3>
		<p>This level takes place on the tiles of Carmen's apartment in the shadows of plants. The coffee cup in the corner leads to the menu.</p>

	<h3>Post-Restoration</h3>
		<p>Helena tells Maria that she feels like she's let Carmen down and that she's lost her job, leaving her unable to help with Carmen's money troubles. She wanted to tell Carmen, but felt that all Carmen cared about was herself. But with all that Helena has lost, she doesn't want to lose Carmen too.</p>
