	<h2>Level 13 - Departure</h2>
	<h3>Pre-Packing</h3>
		<p>The people of <a href="#">Bellariva</a> have taught <a href="#">Maria</a> about what is truly important in life. The player learns that she stole her suitcase from her parents' antique shop on the same day she left home, and she has to be the one to reach out and apologize.</p>
		
	<h3>Packing - Aventura Classic: Suitcase</h3>
		<p>This level takes place on the <a href="#">Hotel</a> tiles. The coffee cup in the corner leads to the menu.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Unlock the clasps of the suitcase. <i>(After this, the order of steps is up to the player.)</i></li>
			<li>Pack clothes.</li>
			<li>Pack the dinosaur.</li>
			<li>Pack the passport.</li>
			<li>Pack the record player.</li>

	<h3>Post-Packing</h3>
		<p>Maria hopes that she has made a difference in Bellariva. <a href="#">Helena</a> and Carmen were able to reunite because they overcame their differences. <a href="#">Joseph</a> realized he couldn't let grief or work get in the way of his relationship with <a href="#">Izzy</a>. Now it was time for Maria to see things through her parents' eyes. She could take the next train and leave, but she thinks she's finally ready to talk to them. And so she calls.</p>
